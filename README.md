## Hey there 👋

I'm **Liubomyr**, an **AI Engineer** based in **Prague**.  
I work on **production-ready AI systems** while actively pursuing a degree focused on **Artificial Intelligence at FIT ČVUT**.

My main interest is **applied AI** — turning models, research, and ideas into reliable systems that can be deployed, scaled, and actually used.

### 🧠Tech Stack
Python, LLM frameworks, GenAI pipelines, REST & backend APIs, Docker, Git, cloud-based systems, Unity and Unreal Engine.
LLMs & GenAI, applied Machine Learning, NLP, Computer Vision, AI system design, evaluation, and deployment.  


### 💼 Examples of my work
- Designed and deployed end-to-end AI pipelines in Python, integrating LLMs and generative models into production-oriented systems with APIs, containerization, and safety considerations.
- Built and integrated real-time AI features into interactive environments, including voice, text, and generative components connected directly to application logic.
- Led the development of a fully published **mobile game**, managing everything from core mechanics and level generation to ads optimization and deployment on **Android and iOS**. I handled all technical and game design aspects as a solo developer, taking the project from idea to release, including testing and feedback analysis.
